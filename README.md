## Once Upon a Keyboard

In a world woven with the threads of algorithms and powered by the electricity of innovation, there lived a curious mind named Islam Ali. With nothing but a keyboard and a dream, Islam Ali embarked on a quest‚Äîa quest to conquer the vast realm of computer science through the magical curriculum of the Open Source Society University (OSSU).

As the sun dipped below the digital horizon, Islam Ali sat down at their trusty keyboard, ready to embark on an adventure filled with coding, algorithms, and endless possibilities. Little did they know that this journey would be more profound and transformative than any they had ever imagined.

## Curriculum

The Open Source Society University (OSSU) computer science curriculum is a structured and comprehensive roadmap that guides my learning journey. Below, I've outlined the mathematics and core courses and topics included in the curriculum:

## üìê Mathematics

Mathematics is the backbone of computer science, providing the essential foundation for understanding algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving. In this section, I'll document my progress and resources related to the mathematical aspects of the OSSU curriculum.



### üìö Courses

1. **[Arithmatics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic#arithmetic-subject-challenge)**: Introduction to the basic arithmetic operations which are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, also includes more advanced operations, such as manipulations of percentages and square roots.
2. **[Basic geometry and measurement](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/basic-geo#basic-geo-subject-challenge)**: This Basic geometry and measurement course is a refresher of length, area, perimeter, volume, angle measure, and transformations of 2D and 3D figures.
3. **[Pre-algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra#pre-algebra-subject-challenge)**: Introduction to the idea that an equals sign, rather than just being the answer to a question as in basic arithmetic, means that two sides are equivalent and can be manipulated together. Also you will learn how numbers, variables, and words can be used in the same ways.
4. **[Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home)**: The study of algebra plays a pivotal role in building a strong mathematical foundation, which is crucial for various areas of computer science. In this course, I explore the entire spectrum of algebraic concepts covered in the curriculum.
5. **Integrated Math**: Integrated Math encompasses various mathematical concepts and skills that are essential for computer science and its applications. In the next courses, I explore different aspects of integrated mathematics:
  - ***[Integrated Math 1](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/math1)***
  - ***[Integrated Math 2](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/math2)***
  - ***[Integrated Math 3](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/math3)***
