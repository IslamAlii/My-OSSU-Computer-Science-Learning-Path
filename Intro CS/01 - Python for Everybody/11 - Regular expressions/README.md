# Chapter Summary: Regular Expressions
**Date: October 9, 2023**

This README provides a summary of the key concepts covered in the chapter on Regular Expressions. In this chapter, we explored the following topics:

## Character Matching in Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for matching and manipulating strings. We learned how to use regex to match specific characters and character classes in strings.

## Extracting Data Using Regular Expressions

Regex can be used to extract specific data patterns from text. We discussed how to define capture groups to retrieve specific portions of matched text.

## Combining Searching and Extracting

We combined search and extraction techniques using regex to find specific patterns and then extract relevant data from the matched text.

## Escape Character

The escape character (backslash \) is used in regex to treat metacharacters as literal characters. We covered how to escape special characters to match them literally.


## Summary

- **^:** Matches the beginning of the line.
- **$:** Matches the end of the line.
- **.:** Matches any character (a wildcard).
- **\s:** Matches a whitespace character.
- **\S:** Matches a non-whitespace character (opposite of \s).
- **\*:** Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match zero or more times.
- **\*?:** Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match zero or more times in "non-greedy mode."
- **+:** Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match one or more times.
- **+?:** Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match one or more times in "non-greedy mode."
- **?:** Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match zero or one time.
- **??:** Applies to the immediately preceding character(s) and indicates to match zero or one time in "non-greedy mode."
- **[aeiou]:** Matches a single character as long as that character is in the specified set. In this example, it would match "a," "e," "i," "o," or "u," but no other characters.
- **[a-z0-9]:** Specifies ranges of characters using the minus sign. This example matches a single character that must be a lowercase letter or a digit.
- **[^A-Za-z]:** When the first character in the set notation is a caret (^), it inverts the logic. This example matches a single character that is anything other than an uppercase or lowercase letter.
- **( ):** When parentheses are added to a regular expression, they are ignored for the purpose of matching but allow you to extract a particular subset of the matched string rather than the whole string when using findall().
- **\b:** Matches the empty string but only at the start or end of a word.
- **\B:** Matches the empty string but not at the start or end of a word.
- **\d:** Matches any decimal digit; equivalent to the set [0-9].
- **\D:** Matches any non-digit character; equivalent to the set [^0-9].


## Glossary

**Brittle Code:** Code that works when the input data is in a particular format but is prone to breakage if there is some deviation from the correct format. We call this "brittle code" because it is easily broken.

**Greedy Matching:** The notion that the + and * characters in a regular expression expand outward to match the largest possible string.

**Grep:** A command available in most Unix systems that searches through text files looking for lines that match regular expressions. The command name stands for "Generalized Regular Expression Parser."

**Regular Expression:** A language for expressing more complex search strings. A regular expression may contain special characters that indicate that a search only matches at the beginning or end of a line or many other similar capabilities.

**Wildcard:** A special character that matches any character. In regular expressions, the wildcard character is the period (.).

## Assignment Completion

I am proud to announce that I have successfully completed and delivered the assignments for this chapter on the course website [py4e](https://www.py4e.com/). 

Each assignment was carefully reviewed, solutions were provided, and the completed work was submitted on time. I am committed to applying the knowledge gained during this chapter to practical assignments and assessments.

This accomplishment marks a significant milestone in my journey to mastering Python programming, and I am excited to continue learning and applying these skills in future chapters and projects.
