# Chapter Summary: Regular Expressions
**Date: October 9, 2023**

This README provides a summary of the key concepts covered in the chapter on Regular Expressions. In this chapter, we explored the following topics:

## Character Matching in Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for matching and manipulating strings. We learned how to use regex to match specific characters and character classes in strings.

## Extracting Data Using Regular Expressions

Regex can be used to extract specific data patterns from text. We discussed how to define capture groups to retrieve specific portions of matched text.

## Combining Searching and Extracting

We combined search and extraction techniques using regex to find specific patterns and then extract relevant data from the matched text.

## Escape Character

The escape character (backslash \) is used in regex to treat metacharacters as literal characters. We covered how to escape special characters to match them literally.

## Glossary

**Brittle Code:** Code that works when the input data is in a particular format but is prone to breakage if there is some deviation from the correct format. We call this "brittle code" because it is easily broken.

**Greedy Matching:** The notion that the + and * characters in a regular expression expand outward to match the largest possible string.

**Grep:** A command available in most Unix systems that searches through text files looking for lines that match regular expressions. The command name stands for "Generalized Regular Expression Parser."

**Regular Expression:** A language for expressing more complex search strings. A regular expression may contain special characters that indicate that a search only matches at the beginning or end of a line or many other similar capabilities.

**Wildcard:** A special character that matches any character. In regular expressions, the wildcard character is the period (.).

## Assignment Completion

I am proud to announce that I have successfully completed and delivered the assignments for this chapter on the course website [py4e](https://www.py4e.com/). 

Each assignment was carefully reviewed, solutions were provided, and the completed work was submitted on time. I am committed to applying the knowledge gained during this chapter to practical assignments and assessments.

This accomplishment marks a significant milestone in my journey to mastering Python programming, and I am excited to continue learning and applying these skills in future chapters and projects.
