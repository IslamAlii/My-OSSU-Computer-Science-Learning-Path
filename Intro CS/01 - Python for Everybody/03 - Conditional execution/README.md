# Chapter: Conditional Execution

**Date: October 3, 2023**

In this chapter, we explored the concept of conditional execution in programming, which allows us to make decisions and execute specific code based on conditions. Here are the key topics covered:

## Boolean Expressions

Boolean expressions are statements that evaluate to either True or False.

## Logical Operators

Logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not` are used to combine and manipulate Boolean expressions.

## Conditional Execution

Conditional statements, like `if`, `else`, and `elif`, enable us to execute code blocks based on certain conditions.

## Alternative Execution

Alternative execution allows us to provide different actions for different conditions.

## Chained Conditionals

Chained conditionals involve multiple `if` and `elif` statements to handle various cases.

## Nested Conditionals

Nested conditionals involve placing conditional statements inside other conditional blocks.

## Catching Exceptions using Try and Except

We learned how to handle exceptions and errors gracefully using `try` and `except` blocks.

## Short-Circuit Evaluation of Logical Expressions

- In programming, logical expressions often involve the use of logical operators like and and or to combine multiple conditions. Short-circuit evaluation refers to the behavior of these operators when they encounter an expression that already determines the outcome of the entire expression.
- `and` Operator: With the `and` operator, if the left condition is `False`, the entire expression becomes `False`, and there's no need to evaluate the right condition. This optimization ensures that the right condition is only checked when necessary.
- `or` Operator: Similarly, with the `or` operator, if the left condition is `True`, the whole expression becomes `True`, and the right condition is not evaluated.
- Short-circuit evaluation is valuable because it can optimize code execution by avoiding unnecessary evaluations, especially when dealing with complex or resource-intensive conditions. It ensures that evaluations are performed only when they can potentially change the final result, improving efficiency and performance.

Where we construct a logical expression with additional comparisons to take advantage of the short-circuit behavior.


## Debugging

Debugging techniques were practiced to identify and fix errors in our code.

## Glossary

- **Body**: The sequence of statements within a compound statement.
- **Boolean Expression**: An expression whose value is either True or False.
- **Branch**: One of the alternative sequences of statements in a conditional statement.
- **Chained Conditional**: A conditional statement with a series of alternative branches.
- **Comparison Operator**: One of the operators that compares its operands: ==, !=, >, <, >=, and <=.
- **Conditional Statement**: A statement that controls the flow of execution depending on some condition.
- **Condition**: The boolean expression in a conditional statement that determines which branch is executed.
- **Compound Statement**: A statement that consists of a header and a body. The header ends with a colon (:), and the body is indented relative to the header.
- **Guardian Pattern**: A technique where we construct a logical expression with additional comparisons to take advantage of the short-circuit behavior.
- **Logical Operator**: One of the operators that combines boolean expressions: and, or, and not.
- **Nested Conditional**: A conditional statement that appears in one of the branches of another conditional statement.
- **Traceback**: A list of the functions that are executing, printed when an exception occurs.
- **Short Circuit**: When Python is part-way through evaluating a logical expression and stops the evaluation because Python knows the final value for the expression without needing to evaluate the rest.
