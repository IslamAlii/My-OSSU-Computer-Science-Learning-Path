### Session Highlights

During this session, I accomplished the following key milestones:

#### 1. Installing Python

I successfully installed Python on my computer, which is the first step in my programming journey. It's exciting to have a development environment ready to go.

#### 2. Terminal Commands

I learned some essential terminal commands that will be invaluable as I progress in my programming adventures. These commands include navigating directories, creating files, and executing Python scripts.

#### 3. Writing My First Line of Code

With Python installed and my terminal skills improving, I wrote my very first line of Python code. It's a simple "Hello, World!" program, but it's the start of something bigger.

```python
print("Hello PY4E World")
```

#### 4. Running My First Python Script

Using the terminal, I executed my "Hello, World!" program and saw the magic of programming in action. The terminal displayed the message, and I felt a sense of accomplishment.

#### 5. Assignment Submission

As part of the course, I completed an assignment that required me to write a Python script to solve a specific problem. I not only wrote the code but also documented it thoroughly. To prove my work, I captured screenshots of the code and the terminal showing the script's output. I then uploaded these images to the course website for assignment submission.
